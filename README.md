Project Lob

Two Goals:
  1) Development of a salt water tank monitoring system that measures:
    - temperature
    - water flow in/out
    - water level

  2) Development of a salt water tank controller that reads tank monitoring
  meaurements and modulates solenoid valves to maintain desired water levels
  accross multiple tanks

Roadmap:
  - prototype individual circuits and scripts for each device
    - temperature probe    - done
    - water flow sensor    - done
    - water level sensor   - done
    - solenoid valve       - done
  - combine circuits/software for tank monitoring unit - done
  - deliver tank monitoring unit(s) - in progress
  - prototype software for the tank controller - in progress
